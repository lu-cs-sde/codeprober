# CodeProber - Source code based exploration of program analysis results

An implementation of property probes.

Documentation for using and integrating with CodeProber is available on the [CodeProber website](https://codeprober.org/docs/). The sources for that website are available in [docs](docs/).

To get started using CodeProber, please read [Download and Run](https://codeprober.org/docs/usage/download_and_run.html).

Alternatively if you want a quick demo of what CodeProber looks like, you can watch this video (5 minutes): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KvFy5h9W0

## Artifact

If you want to try CodeProber, but don't have an analysis tool of your own, you can try out the playground at https://github.com/Kevlanche/codeprober-playground/.

You can also download the artifact to our Property probe paper, found here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7185242.

Both options let you use CodeProber with a Java compiler/analyzer called IntraJ (https://github.com/lu-cs-sde/IntraJ).
