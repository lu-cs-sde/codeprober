A list of system properties supported by the CodeProber server.
These are passed as Java system properties, e.g `java -Dkey=val -jar codeprober.jar etc`.
Most properties must be explicitly set in the terminal (or use `jvmArgs` in the gradle plugin).
A small number of properties are possible to set programatically in your `CodeProber_parse` function.
For example:
```java
public static Object CodeProber_parse(String[] args) {
  System.setProperty("cpr.type_identification_style", "NODE_LABEL");
  // ... then proceed with actual parsing ...
}
```
This works because CodeProber only reads certain properties **after** calling `CodeProber_parse`.
The properties for which this works are marked with `Y` in the `Late Read` column.

# Common properties
These are common, may be of interest to most developers.

| cpr.type_identification_style | REFLECTION    | CodeProber tries keeping track of AST nodes while the user is making modifications to the source document of the tracked node. This is achieved with "Node Locators" (see [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2024.111980) for details). Node locators sometimes use the "type" of a tracked AST node as a search criteria. By default, the "type" is the Java class. However, for ["wrapper"](https://github.com/lu-cs-sde/codeprober/tree/master/minimal-probe-wrapper) implementations, all nodes have the same Java class. This makes the node tracking significantly worse. To overcome this, you may want to set this property to `NODE_LABEL`. If you do, then CodeProber will use the result of `cpr_nodeLabel` as the type instead. | Y         |
| cpr.workspace                 | null          | Set a directory to be used as a workspace (~"file system") in the CodeProber UI. This becomes a persistent directory for CodeProber content to be saved to/loaded from. CodeProber will also store some metadata in the workspace, such as what probes are currently active. This is stored in directories called `.cpr`. You may want to add `workspace/**/.cpr` to your `.gitignore`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | N         |
| cpr.workspaceFilePattern      | null          | Set a regex to filter the file names visible in `cpr.workspace`. Note that `.cpr` directories (those with metadata) are always filtered out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | N         |
| cpr.backing_file              | null          | Set a file to represent the text content inside the CodeProber editor. Changes in CodeProber get saved to disk, and vice versa. This can be seen as a smaller, single-file version of `cpr.workspace`. You cannot use `cpr.workspace` and `cpr.backing_file` simultaneously.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | N         |

# Uncommon properties
Highly specialized and/or legacy properties, should generally be avoided.
If you look in the codebase you may find more properties that are not in this list. They are even more specialized/legacy and should definitely be avoided.

| cpr.session_logger_dir     | null          | A place to write session logs. This is a feature that makes CodeProber store a tiny JSON object for most interactions that reach the server. For example, this logs each requestÂ type and timestamp, when the client connects to the server, etc. The collected files are written to disk in the path specified by this property. Nothing is ever sent over the network, it only writes to disk. This is used for gathering data on CodeProber usage, but is not of interest to most normal users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | N         |
| cpr.resetASTStateOnParse   | true          | If `true`, then call `state().reset()` on newly parsed AST roots. This property was introduced to work around JastAdd's circular evaluation state not being reset. Normally, JastAdd tools are used on the terminal, where they compute something very briefly and then shut down. While computing, JastAdd maintains a "state" that tracks circular attribute evaluations. **If** attribute evaluation results in an exception being thrown, this state does not get correctly reset. Normally this is not a problem, since the JVM is likely to shut down after an exception. However, CodeProber will catch the exception, and keep using the same JVM state, meaning the incorrect circular state is retained. By leaving this property on `true`, CodeProber always resets the state "just in case". | N         |
| cpr.verbose                | false         | Intended for increasing logging verbosity. Currently only affects `--test`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | N         |
| cpr.storeWorkspaceMetadata | true          | If true, store workspace metadata (active probe windows) under `.cpr` directories. If false, the window information is stored locally in the browser, and is lost upon reload.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | N         |
| cpr.workspaceFindFileLimit | 500           | Max number of files to return when using the "Find File" feature in a workspace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | N         |
